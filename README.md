# 10_Days_of_Algos


-- ABOUT --
This was a little project I decided to do where I learned about, or perhaps created, an algorithm and wrote the algorithm in python. I call this "10 DAYS OF ALGORITHMS" (I know its a dumb name.) The idea is that every day for 10 days I would create code for an algorithm. I started procrastinating however, and only made it to day 8. I do intend to eventually finish this, however. I did this simply as a way to excercise my python skills (I had just started learning python), as well as a way to learn and have fun with some algorithms. Most of the Algorithms I did have to do with math, as opposed to sorting or such (though I did do one sorting algorithm.)

-- DISCLAIMER --
The code here may or may not be TERRIBLE. I am still too new at this to be able to tell. Also, I am by no means an expert with algorithms, I am still a serious novice when it comes to algorithms. Some of the algorithms may be terribly ineffecient compared to other alternate algorithms that are available. Even though I know that most people reading this will know better already, PLEASE, for the love of god, don't use this code for anything you might do. Use the math library or something else.
